### current projects:

[ktool](https://github.com/cxnder/ktool) is a multi-purpose, 100% cross platform toolkit+library for MachO/ObjC dumping, analysis, and editing.

It includes a cross-platform, hand-crafted TUI, and works on Windows, mobile devices, your browser, and plenty of other absurd places. 

I've used it to create [sdk-builder](https://github.com/cxnder/sdk-builder) which automatically generates all of the iOS Header dumps for https://headers.cynder.me/ using github actions.

`pip3 install k2l`

[dragon](https://dragon.krit.me/) is a build system targeting iOS/macOS/etc, featuring lightning-fast build times. `pip3 install dragon`

[iBoot-IDA](https://github.com/hack-different/iBoot-IDA) is an IDA plugin for loading both 32 and 64 bit SecureROM/iBoot dumps into IDA Pro 7.0+ (including encrypted im4ps!). 

Formerly iBootLoader, it has been moved to the hack-different org. PRs very heavily appreciated, reach out to me on the hack-different discord if you need any help/guidance!
